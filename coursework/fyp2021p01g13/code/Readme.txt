- Before you run our notebook, please make sure you insert raw data to data > raw

- Since we modified lookup table with variables (see explanation within ntb), we also included references folder with the modified excel spreadsheet

- To sum it up, to run our notebook, all you need to do is to submit the raw data to specified location (In case you would change the folder structure, then you would also have to change constants within notebook setup section - see the ntb)

- Final note, please do not delete the folder interim within data folder because once the data are filtered they are saved here as we were instructed in exercise 2.

Hope everything runs well!

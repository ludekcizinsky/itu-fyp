## About
In this project, we use sample of data from ISIC challenge 2017 in order to build a new dataset describing features of image lesions. More speciffically, we focus on Assymetry, border irregularity and color. Finally, we use these features to investigate the following two research questions:
- Given the extracted features, how well can we distinguish between healthy and melanoma lesion?
- Given the extracted features, how well can we distinguish between healthy and keratosis lesion?

See the results in [report](report.pdf).

## Reproduce results

## About
The key objective of the first year project was to get an introduction to the
entire data science pipeline, i.e., from defining the project objective, through
data cleaning all the way to final report. This was done through a series of
four group projects:

- [analysis of car accidents in Manchester (UK)](coursework/fyp2021p01g13): `qualitative data`
- [analysis of Netherlands' COVID-19 and weather data](coursework/fyp2021p02g13): `quantitative data`
- [analysis of skin lesions](coursework/fyp2021p03g13): `image data`
- [analysis of tweets](coursework/fyp2021p04g13): `nlp data`

If you have any questions, please get in touch with me at luci@itu.dk.

## How to collaborate
To collaborate on all four projects, we used [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com).
As a result Deepnote team reach out to me and made a short [article](https://deepnote.com/education/group-projects) about the
experience with their platform. With that being said, if you plan to do your
project based on scripts (rather than on notebook(s)), I would just use Github.
Here is an [example](https://github.com/jonas-mika/glass-forensic-analysis)
project. As a rule of thumb, if you are comfortable with programming, then
perhaps scripts is the way to go, otherwise, I would start with notebook.

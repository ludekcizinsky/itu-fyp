## About
The key objective of the first year project was to get an introduction to the
entire data science pipeline, i.e., from defining the project objective, through
data cleaning all the way to final report. This was done through a series of
four group projects:

- [analysis of car accidents in Manchester (UK)](coursework/fyp2021p01g13): `qualitative data`
- [analysis of Netherlands' COVID-19 and weather data](coursework/fyp2021p02g13): `quantitative data`
- [analysis of skin lesions](coursework/fyp2021p03g13): `image data`
- [analysis of tweets](coursework/fyp2021p04g13): `nlp data`
